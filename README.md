# SimpleViewer

![simpleViewer](simpleViewer.png "Helium lite SimpleViewer")

SimpleViewer is an off-shoot of my Helium 3 project on github.  I figured
there may be others wading into the new WkWebView area and would apperciate
a starting point - I would.

Anyway, similar to Helium, SimpleViewer is intended to be a simple viewer
of web pages, documents, etc supported by Apple's new WkWebView App kit
framework.

It supports Apple's sandbox, drag-n-drop, and file open.  Being a viewer, it
does not explicitly write out user's files etc, but being a document based
app, will remember documents last seen.

This is a working prototype, aka some things do not work - ie.. auto layout, 
but I plan to address these issues once I figure out how, or learn from others.

So enjoy.
