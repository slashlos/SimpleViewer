# SimpleViewer


SimpleViewer is an off-shoot of the Helium 3 project on github.  I figured
there may be others wading into the new WkWebView area and owuld apprciate
a starting point - I would.

Anyway, similar to Helium, SimpleViewer is intended to be a simple viewer
of web pages, documents, etc supported by Apple's new WkWebView App kit
framework.
